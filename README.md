# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Jerome Manarang!

I'm a third-year Computer Science student at the University of California, Irvine, with a passion for full-stack development. My projects focus on creating clean and impactful experiences for users. 

Currently, I'm diving deeper into advanced CSS and C, continuously expanding my skill set.

I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to apply my skills in innovative ways.

Feel free to explore through my projects! You will find that I code frequently in JavaScript, HTML/CSS, and Python!
